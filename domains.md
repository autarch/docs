TPF Domain registration
=======================

## Aim:

Safeguard important domains for the future of Perl

## Resources:

[pair Networks](http://www.pairnic.com/) has graciously allowed TPF to keep
all of our names registered at [pairNIC.com](http://www.pairnic.com/) at no cost.

## Details

You are giving ownership of these domains to TPF, that said whilst you are
around it is your decision what happens with the DNS...

 * Can I have the full ownership back - No, it defeats the purpose of this project
 * Can I still use my own DNS? - YES, or we'll run it as you request.
 * How do I get records updated if you do the DNS - email us and we'll try be as quick as possible
 * Will you do email forwarding - YES
 * Can I have access to make changes myself - Sorry, no, it's a single account that will manage everything

## How to get your domain added?

 * Unlock transfer
 * Copy Authorization Key
 * Email Dan@DWright.Org (mention any specific DNS requirements)
